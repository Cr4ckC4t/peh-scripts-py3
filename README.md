# PEH Scripts (for `python3`)

The [Practical Ethical Hacking course by TheCyberMentor](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course) includes several scripts that students can either recreate themselves or download from the [official repository](https://github.com/TCM-Course-Resources/Practical-Ethical-Hacking-Resources).

The author does a great job at keeping the course contents up-to-date but also leaves the students place for improvement on some of the scripts. Thus, I am going to put up a few updated versions of scripts. 

The updates are mostly minor fixes regarding performance, error handling and python3 compatibility.

**If you find any problems with the code please do let me know by opening an issue.**
